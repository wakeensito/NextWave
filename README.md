## Next Wave: Your AI-Powered Career Compass

Choosing a career is easy. Understanding the path to get there? That's the hard part.
The Problem: Students at MDC North Campus dream of becoming architects, engineers, and healthcare professionals—but navigating the maze of associate degrees, transfer requirements, certifications, and licensing exams leaves them overwhelmed and uncertain.
Our Solution: Next Wave is an AI-powered career pathway platform that transforms "I want to be a Mechanical Engineer" into a crystal-clear roadmap. In seconds, students receive:

Complete educational progressions from their MDC A.A./A.S. through Ph.D. programs
Transfer plans with articulation agreements to partner institutions
Professional requirements including licensing exams (FE, PE), certifications, and internships
Alternative pathways so students can choose the route that fits their goals

**Why It Matters:** We're not just showing students where to go—we're empowering them to make informed decisions with program comparisons, financial planning tools, and personalized recommendations. Every student deserves to see the full picture of their future, not just the first step.
Next Wave: From career aspiration to professional achievement, we've charted the course.


### Project Description

Next Wave is an AI-powered career pathway planning platform developed for MDC North Campus. Our platform addresses the critical need for students to have a holistic approach to career planning by providing comprehensive, personalized educational pathways from associate degrees through advanced graduate studies.

#### The Challenge

MDC North Campus recognized that students often struggle to navigate the complex journey from career aspiration to professional achievement. Traditional advising methods don't provide students with:
- Clear visibility into the complete educational pathway required for their chosen career
- Information about transfer requirements and articulation agreements
- Understanding of required certifications and licensing exams
- Alternative pathways when multiple routes exist

#### Our Solution

Next Wave enables students to select a career choice—such as Architect or Mechanical Engineer—and automatically generates a complete educational pathway. Each pathway includes:

**Complete Educational Progression:**
- A.A./A.S. degree programs at MDC
- B.S. degree transfer options
- M.S. and Ph.D. pathways (when applicable)
- Articulation agreements between MDC and partner institutions

**Professional Requirements:**
- Required internships and experiential learning opportunities
- Licensing exams (e.g., Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) and Practice of Engineering (PE) exams for Mechanical Engineers)
- Optional and required certifications with their associated requirements
- Timing and sequencing recommendations

**Alternative Pathways:**
- All potential MDC programs that can lead to the desired career
- Multiple route options when available
- Comparison tools to help students make informed decisions

#### Key Features

1. **Career Wizard** - AI-powered career pathway generator that creates personalized educational roadmaps
2. **Program Comparison** - Side-by-side analysis of degree programs, certifications, and career outcomes
3. **Financial Planner** - Cost calculation and financial aid exploration tools
4. **Comprehensive Database** - Integrated data on MDC programs, transfer agreements, and professional requirements

### How It Works

1. **Career Selection**: Students enter their desired career (e.g., "Architect", "Mechanical Engineer")
2. **Pathway Generation**: Our AI system generates a complete educational pathway including:
   - Starting point: Appropriate MDC associate degree programs
   - Transfer plan: Recommended bachelor's programs with articulation agreements
   - Advanced studies: Master's and Ph.D. options when applicable
   - Professional milestones: Required exams, certifications, and internships
3. **Pathway Comparison**: Students can explore alternative pathways and compare options
4. **Financial Planning**: Integrated tools help students understand costs and plan their educational investment

#### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Backend**: Python (Flask), AWS Lambda
- **Data Processing**: Custom data collection and parsing tools for MDC program information
